Create add/edit lesson form:

       - Last name / first name of teacher and student should be restrictive
       	 so lessons with incorrect names should not be input into the system.
	 Create a function in which on POST the strings, last name/first name
	 of both, student and teacher, are searched for and their student key
	 and teacher key, respectively, are returned for input into the lessons
	 table. Have a look at the database structure.
       - All other fields can have a simple textfield input without lookups.
       - All money inputs are in the form XXXXX.XX, please denote this with a help
       	  or placeholder value.
